summary: Basic concepts of a forward probabilistic hazard and risk analysis
abstract: 'In this online training course, the basic concepts of a forward probabilistic hazard and risk analysis are covered. Within such framework, the attendees will get a first lesson about the concept of fragility and the underlying assumptions of fragility for a class of assets exposed to risk. These concepts are further explored related to empirical fragility assessment. It is explained, at an introductory level, how the Bayesian inference, generalized regression models, and Markov Chan Monte Carlo simulation methods can be used for fitting and selecting the most suitable fragility model, given the available data. The attendees will also get a first glimpse into derivation of vulnerability functions based on convolution of fragility and consequence functions. A special focus is on the treatment and propagation of uncertainties in the fragility model parameters because of limited number of available data.'

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including page elements such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
