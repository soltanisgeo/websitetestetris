We have in program training and user testing for European Tsunami Risk Service (VA2-35-1)(https://eurotsunamirisk.org/) datasets: Empirical Risk Products –Fragility and Vulnerability Curves. This is a two-day virtual user-testing and training, hosted by University College London‘s Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, taking place on Monday 6-7th November 2023 from 9 am to 11 am Central European Time (CET). This two-day course marks UN’s World Tsunami Awareness day on 5th of November.
