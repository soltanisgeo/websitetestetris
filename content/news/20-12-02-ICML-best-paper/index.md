We have in program training and user testing for European Tsunami Risk Service (VA2-35-1)(https://eurotsunamirisk.org/) datasets: Empirical Risk Products –Fragility and Vulnerability Curves. This is a two-day virtual user-testing and training, hosted by University College London‘s Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, taking place on Monday 6-7th November 2023 from 9 am to 11 am Central European Time (CET). This two-day course marks UN’s World Tsunami Awareness day on 5th of November. It is, however, to note that the skills and know-how covered by this course are applicable to any kind of natural hazard (e.g., seismic, flood, hurricane, etc).

Excellent science is enabled and enriched through making the relevant scientific research tools and results directly accessible to the scientific communities and the civil societies. The European Tsunami Risk Service (ETRiS) aims to collect, harmonize and make available tsunami risk related data (e.g., impact, damage, consequences), data products (e.g., fragility and vulnerability curves), software, and services in a way that they are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by a broad user base. The European Tsunami Risk Service is is part of the candidate Thematic Core Service for tsunami and is integrated into the Integrated Core Service Data Portal of the European Plate Observing System (EPOS).
